# Description
This project provides policies for Focused Run - Advanced Configuration Monitoring - Configuration and Security Analytics. Those policies are the basis for validating configuration items of systems which are stored centrally in Focused Run. Policies comprise a set of rules which are ideally derived from a  hardening guide or a system baseline documention. Those policies are used to calculate compliance status of configuration items using application FRUN CSA Validation.

Besides the policies the project provides some powershell scripts which helps you to setup your policies.
